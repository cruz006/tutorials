# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most common coding language. It is a text-based coding language that is used to create applications, interactive web content, and web browsers. An example of JavaScript would be a search bar, refresh button, or playing a video that is linked to Youtube. Unlike Java, which creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser, JavaScript code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code is all in text.

## Getting Started

If you want to learn how to code in JavaScript, all you need is motivation and dedication. This language is very easy to learn. There are many websites and content creators who offer paid and free courses in JavaScript. If you want to get started on Visual Studio Code, follow these steps and you can become proficient in JavaScript.

### Starting on Visual Studio Code

- **Download Visual Studio Code** from your web browser, you can do this by going to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and downloading it from there.
  
- Once you have it up and running, go to the **sidebar** and go to extensions.
- There you can search which **JavaScript extension** is available for code snippets.
- Since VS Code already has JavaScript IntelliSense, debugging, formatting, code navigation, and refactorings. All you need to do is **download JavaScript (ES6) code snippets**.

- These snippets will help since they are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, like loops or conditional statements.
- With everything downloaded and running, you start to learn the language and start a project to familiarize yourself with it.

Some ideas for a first project are a stopwatch, clock, making the pong game, calculator, or a guess the color game.

Once you have gotten used to JavaScript, try to learn TypeScript
